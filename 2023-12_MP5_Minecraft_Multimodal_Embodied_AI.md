## MP5: A Multi-modal Open-ended Embodied System in Minecraft via Active Perception

**Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07472

**Core Contribution**: Introduces a first-of-its-kind embodied AI system that combines multimodal large language models with active perception in Minecraft, achieving remarkable success rates in complex, context-dependent tasks (91%) and process-dependent tasks (22%).

**Why It Matters for A2A**: MP5 represents a significant advancement in agent-to-agent systems by:
1. Implementing a modular architecture that enables sophisticated task decomposition
2. Demonstrating effective goal-conditioned active perception
3. Achieving human-like problem-solving in open-world environments

**Technical Implementation**:
- Utilizes GPT-3.5/4 for task planning and decomposition
- Integrates five functional modules for perception, planning, and execution
- Implements active scene perception for dynamic decision-making
- Project implementation available at: https://iranqin.github.io/MP5.github.io/
