## FER-C: A Soft Benchmark for Calibrating Facial Expression Recognition Models

**Paper**: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FER-C-4197
**Category**: Model Calibration, Computer Vision, AI Safety

### Analysis
FER-C introduces a novel approach to AI-to-AI evaluation where one model acts as a calibration benchmark for another's facial expression recognition capabilities. The framework uniquely employs soft labels to handle out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating how multiple AI systems can work together to improve recognition reliability through structured information exchange.

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Example of soft label generation for model calibration
def generate_soft_labels(visibility_score, base_expression):
    """
    visibility_score: float [0,1] indicating image quality
    base_expression: original expression probability distribution
    """
    soft_label = visibility_score * base_expression + \
                 (1 - visibility_score) * uniform_distribution()
    return soft_label

# Model calibration interface
def calibrate_fer_model(model, calibration_data):
    """
    model: FER model to be calibrated
    calibration_data: Dataset with soft labels
    """
    return temperature_scaling(model, calibration_data)
