# Add MoE-Mamba: First Integration of Mixture of Experts with State Space Models

## Description
Adding MoE-Mamba paper which introduces a groundbreaking combination of Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Mamba's State Space Model architecture. The implementation achieves same performance as vanilla Mamba with 2.35Ã— fewer training steps while maintaining Mamba's inference speed advantages over Transformers.

## Technical Analysis
The paper introduces key architectural innovation by integrating MoE routing into Mamba's SSM blocks. Here's a simplified version of the core MoE-Mamba implementation:

```python
class MoEMambaBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, num_experts=8, top_k=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.moe = MixtureOfExperts(
            dim=dim,
            num_experts=num_experts,
            top_k=top_k
        )
        self.mamba_block = MambaBlock(dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Route through MoE
        moe_out, routing_weights = self.moe(x)
        
        # Process through Mamba SSM
        ssm_out = self.mamba_block(moe_out)
        
        return ssm_out, routing_weights
